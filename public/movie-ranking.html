<hr />
<h3>Alien Autopsy</h3>
<p> A Humoristic reconstruction of the 1995 scandal related to the fake documentary The Alien Autopsy (1995) about the Roswell incident.I have never laughed so much in my life!</p>
<h3>Yes Man</h3>
<p>After attending a self-help seminar, Carl decides to say yes to everything in life to let go of his negativity. However, he learns that too much of positivity isn't that great either.I believe this is the last good movie I've watched before everything became woke.</p>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>John Wick, a former hitman who is drawn back into the criminal underworld he had previously abandoned. He is very creative with how he unalives people and is the pettiest character on television.</p>
